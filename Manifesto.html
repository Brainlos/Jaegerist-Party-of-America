        <br>Below is the introduction.<br>
        THE JAEGERIST MANIFESTO<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is in terror of a power that could bring it to ruins. The power of Eren Yeager, leader of the Yeagerist party. This terror arose after a festival held in Liberio, when when Willy Tybur narrated a play performed for a gathering of dignitaries, of all nations besides Paradis.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described Eren Yeager’s rise, gaining power over 10 million colossal titans. Fearing xenophobia, the gathering of dignitaries deemed Eren Yeager a threat they needed to eliminate. Tybur’s arguement begs a question, however.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one can not blindly assume the goals of another whom they have only just become aware of, what does Eren Yeager truly want to achieve with the power to flatten anything and everything in the world?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inform the world of Eren Yeager’s goals, this declaration has been written by Eren Yeager and high ranking supporters in the Jaegerist party, gathered together on Paradis island in 854.
